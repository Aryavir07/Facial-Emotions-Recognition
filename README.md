# Facial-Expression-Recognition

## Project Overview
- The aim of project is to classify people's emotions based on their face images.
- Project is divided into two parts which is combined to give output:
				1. Facial key points detection model
				2. Facial expression detection model

------------
## Model 1: Key Facial Point Detection

**How?**
- Dataset contsists of x and y coordinates of 15 facial key points
**Input Image -> Trained Key Facial Points -> Detector Model**

## Model 2: Facial Expression Detection
- This model classifies people's emotion.
- Data contains images that belongs to five categories:
> **0 -> Angry**
> **1 -> Disgust**
> **2 -> Sad**
> **3 -> Happy**
> **4 -> Surprise**
